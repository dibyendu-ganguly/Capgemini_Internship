 * 6.Write a Java program to find the number of seed Lychrel number candidates and related numbers for n in the range 1..10000 inclusive. 
 * (With that iteration limit of 500). 
A Lychrel number is a natural number that cannot form a 
palindrome through the iterative process of repeatedly 
reversing its digits and adding the resulting numbers. 
This process is sometimes called the 196-algorithm, 
after the most famous number associated with the process.
The first few Lychrel numbers are 196, 295, 394, 493, 592, 689, 691, 788, 790, 879, 887, ... .
Expected Output :
5 Lychrel seeds: [196, 879, 1997, 7059, 9999]
244 Lychrel related
5 Lychrel palindromes: [196, 879, 1997, 7059, 9999]
